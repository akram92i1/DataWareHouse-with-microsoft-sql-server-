# DataWareHouse-with-microsoft-sql-server-
Some data warehouse using Mssms (Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio 18 ) 


this Repo conatin some of my practice in the data warehouse think like : 
.how to split A database on two data warehouse using date like
    -> DW1 contain  the 2019 sell data 
    -> DW2 contain the 2018 sell data 
      --> And the main Database is ERP_BDD that conatin some of random generated data with only SQL commands all the (.sql) file represent the code and i will comments every file later and what every function do
If you use this .sql  it's can be a litle difficult to inderstand wich function do what. And There beacause it's my perssonal practice work and I charge as much as I can to organize everything. 


Thank you .
